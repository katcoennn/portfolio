    <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 6 Reflection</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">I thought that Python and Scratch were actually quite similar. The commands all <br>appeared to use the same logic, so I think it was super helpful that we learned how <br>to code of Scratch first. I did find it tedious that on Python, there is no "point in <br>direction" command (there probably is but I haven't found it yet). Overall I thought <br>the transtion wasn't that hard. <br> <br> Though I did spend time debugging my programming, they were mostly simple <br>problems arising from my inexperience. It was still pretty amazing when the code <br>worked though. </p>

    <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 7 Reflection</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">I really enjoyed today. Even though I kind of messed up my code by not having a <br>backup in case the user input was wrong, I thought the coding was pretty straight <br>forward. I defintely thought that mapping out the project before we coded was a <br>major help! I think I could definitely work on making my nested conditionals easier <br>to follow, I wasn't using functions and it would probably be hard for anyone to make <br>edits to my code. Overall, I really enjoyed today's project and I was never super <br>confused! </p>

     <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 8 Reflection</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">A list is a collection of different variables. They can contain strings, integers, floats, <br>or doubles. I thought it was useful when we did the challenges this morning- the one <br>about generating a random menu was really cool and a great way to learn about how lists can be used to generate random things. <br> <br>
      Today I worked really well with Kailani! It was really fun to talk about the code with someone before we started writing. It was nice to communicate with a partner when we faced difficulties- the two of us often pushed aside the computer and tried to figure out our problem on paper first. She was really amazing to work with today, probably my favorite partner so far! </p>
