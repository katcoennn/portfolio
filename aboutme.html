    <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 6 Reflection</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">I thought that Python and Scratch were actually quite similar. The commands all appeared to use the same logic, so I think it was super helpful that we learned how to code of Scratch first. I did find it tedious that on Python, there is no "point in direction" command (there probably is but I haven't found it yet). Overall I thought the transtion wasn't that hard. <br> <br> Though I did spend time debugging my programming, they were mostly simple problems arising from my inexperience. It was still pretty amazing when the code worked though. </p>
