    <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 6 Reflection</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">I thought that Python and Scratch were actually quite similar. The commands all appeared to use the same logic, so I think it was super helpful that we learned how to code of Scratch first. I did find it tedious that on Python, there is no "point in direction" command (there probably is but I haven't found it yet). Overall I thought the transtion wasn't that hard. <br> <br> Though I did spend time debugging my programming, they were mostly simple problems arising from my inexperience. It was still pretty amazing when the code worked though. </p>

    <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 7 Reflection</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">I really enjoyed today. Even though I kind of messed up my code by not having a backup in case the user input was wrong, I thought the coding was pretty straight foward. I defintely thought that mapping out the project before we coded was a major help! I think I could definitely work on making my nested conditionals easier to follow, I wasn't using functions and it would probably be hard for anyone to make edits to my code. Overall, I really enjoyed today's project and I was never super confused! </p>

      <br>
     <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 8 Reflection</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">A list is a collection of different variables. They can contain strings, integers, floats, or doubles. I thought it was useful when we did the challenges this morning- the one about generating a random menu was really cool and a great way to learn about how lists can be used to generate random things. <br> <br>
      Today I worked really well with Kailani! It was really fun to talk about the code with someone before we started writing. It was nice to communicate with a partner when we faced difficulties- the two of us often pushed aside the computer and tried to figure out our problem on paper first. She was really amazing to work with today, probably my favorite partner so far! </p>

     <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Refinery 29 Reflection</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">Today I really loved going to Refinery 29. It was a really fun destination for girls our age and I thought they were super accommodating. I really loved the groups- having three or four Refinery employees work with us and help us out make the task easier to understand. I really thought it was amazing coming up with the ideas for code- it was really fun seeing how computer science is applicable even in a blog/media outlet. I loved today and really hope some of the other field trips will be just as fun, interactive, and educational!  </p>

      <br>
     <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Python  Challenges Reflection</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">Today was lots of fun! I loved working with Kristy, she was lots of fun to talk about the code with. We got really far with our roullete code by teamwork and utilizing the two computers to focus on atom and google at the same time. The challenges were really fun- I enjoyed our little break from the ciriculum. Overall, today was a blast! </p>

     <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 1 Reflection- Intro to Robotics </h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">Today was very hard. I thought the scavenger hunt was fun, but I'm not sure we all had the same definitions. I felt a bit overwhelmed with the circuit board- my group wasn't quite sure how to do anything and I don't think we did an amazing job at communicating or breaking the code up. If one person wrote the code and someone was working on the breadboard, the person on the breadboard rewrote the code themselves instead of breaking up the work. It wasn't very cohesive and I think it made working on a new subject rather difficult.</p>
    <br>
      <br>
     <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 2 Reflection </h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">I thought today was really fun. After yesterday, I wasn't feeling great about robotics in general. Today my group did face some difficulties, but we definitely tried really hard to work together to fix them. Some of us were better at software and some of us were better at hardware, so we broke into groups, tried to figure out the problem, and then each group taught the other half. It was a great learnign experience and I definitely took a lot out of today!</p>
    <br>
      <br>
     <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 3 Reflection </h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">Today was really hard. My group couldn't get the knight racer to work this morning, and we still struggled to make the robot dance. Eventually we did use functions, which made it easier to understand, but we never figured out how to play music and have the robot dance at the same time. So far, I'm not a fan of robotics. </p>
     <br>
      <br>
     <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Day 4 Reflection </h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;">Today was pretty cool. My group got te button working right away and it was really cool. I think it was super helpful when we put our code on a google doc for everyone to see, and if someone didn't understand a segment of the code, one member would add a comment to explain what they did or why it was necessary in te code. We did have a hard time with the whisker wires because we were missing the correct pieces. Today I loved the guest speakers, I thought they were both so amazing and it was definitely the highlight of my day. Even though we didn't cover a lot of new ground, my group worked really well together and had lots of fun.  </p>
